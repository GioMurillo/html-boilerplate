        <h1>Things I Wish Somebody Told Me as a Teenager</h1>
        <p>
            1) Stick to what you're good at. In your case, <strong>computers!</strong>
            You probably think you're going to become some racecar designer,
            but reality is, only a small percentage of mechanical engineers do so!
            Instead, your best bet is to stick to computer engineering, creating
            a career that you know you will enjoy. You're going to think that
            you will build more as a mechanical engineer graduate, but in reality,
            building software is one of the best forms of building on your own!
        </p>
        <p>
            2) Learn about finance through <em>reddit.com/financialindepencence</em>.
            Nobody around you knows much about finance, much less talks about it
            with others. You will be starting from the bottom, but if you can
            grasp the key concepts - paying down debt, using credit to your
            advantage, compound interest (which you do end up learning as a senior 
            in M.E.) - you will reach your full potential.
        </p>
        <p>
            3) You've always been curious and inquisitive. Use that! Don't stop
            learning, <em>especially</em> about things that interest you.
        </p>
        <p>
            4) Pass on what you learn to others. You already do this to some extent,
            but really emphasize teaching your brother and sister all that you
            learn in the years to come. They will always be by your side,
            but don't think that means you can be a ghost!
        </p>
        <p>
            5) Appreciate the people who help you along the way. There are going
            to be really tough times. You <strong>will</strong> want to quit.
            However, you will see that there are people in your life who will
            be struggling ride along side with you and who will support you.
            Take the time to thank those people every once in a while.
        </p>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Time is on your side. Don't lose sight of what you are good at,
            what you enjoy doing with your free time, or the people who surround you.
            Put the hard work in early on, and you will become who you are
            destined to be! And even if you do end up studying mechanical
            engineering, you will still succeed (and eventually go back and 
            teach yourself programming again).

            But if you're reading this, I appreciate you joining me on my journey!
            I hope I have been able to make a positive impact in your life.
